# Lab 05

In this lab, you have to create the index and show views of the `Writter` app, using ActionController and ActionView.
Be sure to use the app that you have been using in the previous labs.

## Instructions

1. Create the Association between `Post`'s and `Comment`'s (a post can have multiple comments) at the database level as well as at the Model level.

2. Create a controller for `Post`'s table with the following actions:

- `index`
- `show`

3. Create a route for the resource `Post`.
4. Create an index view to list all posts in the app
5. Create a show view to view one specific post in the app. In this view show all the comments associated with the post at the bottom of the page.

Be sure to include navigation links in the views to return to index view as well as link to enter show views for each post.

Remember you are only creating the `index` and `show` views/actions no other actions for the moment.

## Important

You must use Bootstrap to style your application.
